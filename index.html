	<h3>One of my interests is attending music concerts. I really love live music and think its a fun thing to with family and friends. Some of my favorite shows I've seen were even here at the Santa Barbara Bowl! Some of my favorite shows I've seen include Tyler, The Creator, Coldplay, and Clairo but there are so many more! </h3>

	<h3>There are also many upcoming concerts that I am really looking forward to, like seeing disclosure at the SB Bowl. Though I love music in general, I feel like everyone should go to any concert, if you have the opportunity to and appreciate the live music!</h3>

<!-- I used all raster (jpeg) images for this website. I leared that pngs and jpegs are univerally supported so I stuck with jpegs. I didnt want to have any higher res saving image types because I wanted users to be able to load in those photos quick and easy even if that does mean the resolution is lower. I included text on what an image is if it doesnt load and so people with diablities will be able to understand what the image is trying to show. This also helps search engines like google to be able to push out the website on search pages from the contect of the images. -->
